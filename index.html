                    <p>This Niffler is a magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur. She is
                        attracted to shiny things and are generally harmless and easy going. However, you might want to

                <p>The Bowtruckle, which eats insects, is a peaceable and intensely shy creature but if the tree in
                    which it lives is threatened, it has been known to leap down upon the woodcutter or tree-surgeon
                    attempting to harm its home and gouge at their eyes with its long, sharp fingers. An offering of
                    woodlice will placate the Bowtruckle long enough to let a witch or wizard remove wand-wood from its
                    tree.</p>
